# Modeling a forced cantilever beam using beam elements 

This example shows a simple way to model a cantilever beam using beam elements.

This example has been taken from Nobels (2025), which can be found here: https://repository.tno.nl/SingleDoc?find=UID%20f29c6aa5-7cbd-46b2-8064-305d37841ab4

These examples are the same cantilever beam but with different numerical resolutions.
All the cantilever beams have a length of 4000 mm.
Here the following resolutions are available:
- 4000 mm
- 2000 mm
- 1000 mm
- 500 mm
- 250 mm
- 125 mm
- 62.5 mm
- 31.25 mm
